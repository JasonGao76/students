## Monday:
> Polished final project

> Showed N@TM project to Mr. Lopez, he said it was good

> Work on interview
- For LinkedIn profile, make one if you can / it would be appreciated, but not 100% necessary
- Lopez tips: Focus more on myself and what I did, not what group did + highlight what I did, why I did it, what I found enjoyable, and how I overcame challenges.

## Tuesday:
> Polished final project

## Wednesday:
> N@TM, help team review project

## Thursday:
> Present final interview
- Earned 0.95/1
- Tips:
    - BE PREPARED WITH A QUESTION OR QUESTIONS TO ASK. It shows your interest and care in the job.
    - If talking about someone else, focus on that less and be like oh they were an inspiration to me and I've been trying to replicate / follow them by ___.
    - Try to cut down resume to 1 page for an interview, like a link to a LinkedIn could be good

## Friday:
> Help friend with interview

> Work on other classes
