> Showed N@TM project to Mr. Lopez, he said it was good

> Work on interview
- For LinkedIn profile, make one if you can / it would be appreciated, but not 100% necessary
- Lopez tips: Focus more on myself and what I did, not what group did + highlight what I did, why I did it, what I found enjoyable, and how I overcame challenges.
