## Ideation for Arthur and Jason game for the final project
> Plan:
- Have a matrix / user input to create a _ x _ matrix (start with a matrix)
    - 2d iteration
    - list
- Have randomization (definitely) and user input (maybe) to enter the values into the matrix
- Have the user be able to sort the values within rows and/or columns
    - Can turn this into a puzzle game later if math doesnt work and it doesnt automatically be done in like 2 clicks
    - loops and sorting
        - O(n)
- Function with find and replace, or search for a value and highlight (OR BOTH with find, highlight, and replace)
    - search
    - O(n^2)
> Central page
    - Have the central page be one of the tabs (make .md in the root directory)
    - That page links to all four games
