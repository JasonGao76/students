- Plan:
    - Have a matrix / user input to create a _ x _ matrix (start with a matrix)
        - 2d iteration
        - list
    - Have randomization (definitely) and user input (maybe) to enter the values into the matrix
    - Have the user be able to sort the values within rows and/or columns
        - Can turn this into a puzzle game later if math doesnt work and it doesnt automatically be done in like 2 clicks
        - loops and sorting
            - O(n)
    - Function with find and replace, or search for a value and highlight (OR BOTH with find, highlight, and replace)
        - search
        - O(n^2)
- Central page
    - Have the central page be one of the tabs (make .md in the root directory)
    - That page links to all four games
