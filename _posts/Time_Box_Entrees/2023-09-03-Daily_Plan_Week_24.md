## Tuesday:
> Breakpoint/Debugging Talk
- Frontend
    - Open frontend in browser --> inspect --> sources (might need to open file and refresh to see code) --> place a breakpoint in the fetch code for a request by clicking on the line number --> run the request on the frontend --> breakpoint should stop the program
    - Go through errors / code step by step to see how things are running and being defined
- Backend
    - Place breakpoint in backend VSCode in the api code for where functions/reqeusts are defined (hover over the line number and then click the red circle next to it) --> go to main.py file and run "Python Debugger: Debug Python File" (click the dropdown next to the arrow/play button) ON MAIN.PY --> go to frontend and send the request (where the breakpoint is) to backend --> VSCode will highlight and stop the program
    - Go step by step, see what is being defined as what in the top left, etc.
