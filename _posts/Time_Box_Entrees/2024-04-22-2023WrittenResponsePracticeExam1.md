> Question 1: Describe one piece of documentation that would be appropriate to include with or in your program. Describe the intended purpose of this documentation by identifying who would use it and what they would do with it.
- Question: are we meant to actually have a piece of documentation or is it just if you were to have one, what would be appropriate?
- One piece of documentation that would be appropriate to include in our program would be a rule book. My program is a game intended to help test and improve people's logical thinking to make predictions, so given that the player hopefully reads the rule book before playing, the rule book would help guide them in knowing what themselves and the enemy bot are allowed to do, helping them to properly play and better understand the game. 

> Question 2:
- a. Consider the first iteration statement included in the Procedure section of your Personalized Project Reference. Describe the condition(s) that will cause the body of the iteration statement to execute at least once.
    - 
- b. Consider the procedure identified in part (i) of the Procedure section of your Personalized Project Reference. Write a call to your procedure with specific argument(s) that you could use for testing this procedure. Describe the program functionality that is related to this call.
    - 
- c. Consider the list identified in the List section of your Personalized Project Reference. Explain how you would need to adjust this part of your program if the list was not included in your code.
